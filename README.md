# Tic Tac Toe Game (Python)

## Overview
This is a simple text-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. The game allows a single player to play against the computer, with the player marking 'X' and the computer marking 'O' on a 3x3 grid.

## Features
- Single-player mode against the computer
- Simple text-based interface
- Win and draw conditions
- Replay option at the end of each game

## How to Play
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ParvaVashi/tic-tac-toe.git
   ```

2. **Run the Game**:
   Navigate to the project directory and run the `tic_tac_toe.py` file in a Python environment. This will start the game.
   ```
   cd tic-tac-toe
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

3. **Gameplay**:
   - The game will display a 3x3 grid representing the Tic Tac Toe board.
   - The player will be prompted to enter the row and column numbers (1 to 3) where they want to place their 'X' mark.
   - The computer will then make its move, placing an 'O' mark in an empty spot on the board.
   - The game will continue until either the player or the computer wins, or the game ends in a draw.

4. **End of Game**:
   - At the end of each game, the result (win, lose, or draw) will be displayed.
   - The player will be given the option to play again or exit the game.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter or Pygame for a more interactive experience.
- Add more difficulty levels for the computer player to provide a greater challenge.
- Incorporate a scoring system to keep track of wins, losses, and draws over multiple games.
